## The Lozoya Valley Manifesto

1. Don't change the environment, do adapt yourself to it instead.
2. Use technology as much as you want and need in order to improve your life, as long as you don't harm anyone else's.
3. Move around with sustainable transport. If you need to travel long distances, try to share the mode of transport.
4. Make a good use of the natural resources. Don't waste it over your needs.
5. Enjoy the nature. Invest your time getting to know it better and more often.
6. Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Get to know the local gastronomy.
7. Develop your product through agile methodologies. Be flexible with your working hours. Have your work under control, not the way around.
8. Get to know and respect your neighbors and people around. Treat them as you like them to treat you, regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation.
9. Be transparent and play fairly. Share knowledge and information with no fear.
10. Spread the word. Invite others to live the experience.
